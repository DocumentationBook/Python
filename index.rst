   glossary

Programming languages have their own specific support for inline documentation. This way they help programmers
follow the common `literate programming <http://www.literateprogramming.com/>`_ paradigm proposed by Donald Knuth and
others. This paradigm implies that the main efforts a programmer must do towards creating a meaningful document
for people with a program code in it for a computer, and not vise versa.
